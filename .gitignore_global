# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)

# This is complicated:
#
# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
#  saved in this file.

#  ..but if you're in the 1%, comment out the line "*.pbxuser"
